A soil with a pH of 4 is considered highly acidic. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral, values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are alkaline. Here are some properties of highly acidic soil:



      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Limited Nutrient Availability:</h3><br>Highly acidic soil can hinder the availability of essential nutrients for plant growth. Important nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus may become less accessible to plants at this pH level.
      </p>

      <h3>Aluminum Toxicity: </h3><br>  Aluminum toxicity becomes a concern in soils with a pH of 4. Aluminum ions can be more soluble in acidic conditions, which can harm plant roots and limit their growth
        <h3>Microbial Activity: </h3><br>High acidity can negatively affect soil microbial activity, reducing the decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling processes. This can further limit nutrient availability for plants.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Poor Plant Growth: </h3><br>   Most plants prefer a soil pH that is close to neutral (around 6 to 7). Soil with a pH of 4 can be detrimental to many plants, leading to stunted growth and poor development.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Potential for Toxicity:</h3><br>Some heavy metals, such as manganese, may become more soluble and toxic in highly acidic soils, potentially causing harm to plants and the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Liming Requirement: </h3><br> To improve soil quality and make it suitable for a wider range of crops and plants, you may need to apply lime (calcium carbonate) to raise the pH and reduce soil acidity.
      </p>

      <p>
To address the challenges of highly acidic soil, you may consider soil amendment practices, such as adding lime to raise the pH, incorporating organic matter to improve nutrient retention, and selecting plants that are adapted to acidic conditions. Soils with extreme pH levels may benefit from soil testing and a tailored approach to improve their suitability for specific agricultural or gardening purposes.
