                <h2>         Alluvial Soil</h2>

                <p>
Alluvial soil is the most common type of soil in Delhi and is found in the floodplains of the Yamuna River. It is highly fertile and well-suited for agriculture. Alluvial soil is composed of silt, clay, sand, and gravel deposited by the river over the years.

                <h2>Arid and Semi-Arid Soils</h2>

                <p>
 In the western parts of Delhi, especially in areas near the Aravalli Range, you can find arid and semi-arid soils. These soils tend to be less fertile and have low water-holding capacity, making agriculture more challenging.

                <p>
 Delhi is also known for the Delhi Ridge, which is a hilly terrain. The soils in this region are typically shallow and rocky. They are not very suitable for agriculture but are essential for groundwater recharge and serve as a natural buffer against urbanization.

                <h2>     Sandy Soil</h2>

                <p>
 Sandy soils are found in some parts of Delhi, particularly in the southwestern and southeastern regions. These soils have good drainage properties but may require additional organic matter and nutrients for farming.

                <p>
 Clayey soils, with their fine particles, are found in some parts of Delhi. These soils can retain water well but may become compacted when wet. Proper management is required for agriculture.

                <p>
Loamy soils, which are a balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay, can be found in various parts of Delhi. They are generally fertile and are suitable for a wide range of crops.

        <p>
Red and yellow soils are common in parts of the state, especially in the regions of Nainital, Almora, and Pithoragarh. These soils are generally well-drained and acidic in nature. They are suitable for growing crops like millets, pulses, and fruits.
