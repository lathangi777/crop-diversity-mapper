      <p>
        Arunachal Pradesh, a state in northeastern India, experiences a diverse
        range of climates due to its varied topography and altitudes. The
        climate in Arunachal Pradesh can be categorized into several climatic
        zones:
      </p>

      <p>
        Tropical Monsoon Climate (Arunachal Pradesh Lowlands): The southern and
        western parts of Arunachal Pradesh, including places like Itanagar and
        Naharlagun, have a tropical monsoon climate. This means they have
        relatively high temperatures year-round with distinct wet and dry
        seasons. Summers (May to September) are hot and humid with heavy
        rainfall, while winters (October to April) are cooler and drier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Temperate Climate (Arunachal Pradesh Himalayas): As you move northwards
        into the Himalayan region of Arunachal Pradesh, the climate becomes more
        temperate. Places like Tawang and Bomdila experience colder winters with
        the possibility of snowfall. Summers are milder compared to the
        lowlands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alpine and Tundra Climate (Higher Elevations): At the highest elevations
        in the state, particularly in areas like Sela Pass, you'll find an
        alpine and tundra climate. Here, winters are very cold with heavy
        snowfall, and the summers are short and cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rainfall: Arunachal Pradesh receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon
        season, which typically occurs from June to September. The amount of
        rainfall varies across the state, with the southern regions receiving
        more precipitation compared to the northern parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humidity: Due to its proximity to the Bay of Bengal, many areas in
        Arunachal Pradesh experience high humidity levels during the monsoon
        season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Biodiversity: Arunachal Pradesh's climate diversity contributes to its
        rich biodiversity. The state is home to a wide range of flora and fauna,
        including tropical rainforest species in the lowlands and alpine species
        in the higher elevations.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to note that Arunachal Pradesh's climate can vary
        significantly depending on the specific location and altitude within the
        state. The diverse geography of the region results in a wide range of
        microclimates and weather patterns.
