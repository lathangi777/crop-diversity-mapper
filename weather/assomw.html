          Assam, a state in northeastern India, experiences a subtropical climate
          with a significant monsoon season. The climate in Assam can be classified
          as follows:
      </p><p>
          <h3>Tropical Monsoon Climate (Am):</h3><br> The majority of Assam falls
          under the Am climate classification, as per the Köppen climate
          classification system. This climate is characterized by distinct wet and
          dry seasons.
      </p><p>
          <h3>Summer (March to June): </h3><br>During the summer months, Assam
          experiences high temperatures and humidity. Daytime temperatures can often
          exceed 30°C (86°F) or even higher.
      </p><p>
           <h3>Monsoon (June to September):</h3><br> The
          monsoon season is the most significant climatic feature of Assam. Heavy
          rainfall occurs during this period, with the southwest monsoon bringing
          substantial amounts of precipitation. The state receives a substantial
          portion of its annual rainfall during the monsoon, leading to lush green
          landscapes and flooding in some areas.
      </p> <p>
          <h3>Post-Monsoon (October to November):</h3><br>
          After the monsoon season, the weather becomes more pleasant. Temperatures
          begin to drop, and humidity levels decrease.
      </p> <p>
          <h3>
              Winter (December to
              February):
          </h3><br> The winter season in Assam is relatively mild compared to many
          other parts of India. However, temperatures can drop, especially in the
          early morning and evening. Frost is rare in most parts of the state.
      </p><p>
           It's
          important to note that Assam's climate can vary across different regions
          of the state due to its diverse topography, which includes plains, hills,
          and valleys. The Brahmaputra River and the surrounding areas are
          particularly influenced by the monsoon. Assam's climate is conducive to
          agriculture, and the state is known for its tea plantations, rice
          cultivation, and a variety of other crops. Additionally, the state's
          abundant rainfall supports a rich biodiversity, making it a region of
          ecological significance.
