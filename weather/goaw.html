        Goa, a state in India, experiences a tropical monsoon climate. Here are
        some characteristics of the climate in Goa:
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Wet Season:</h3><br> Goa has a distinct wet season, which occurs during the
        monsoon months of June to September. During this period, the region
        receives heavy rainfall, and the weather is characterized by high
        humidity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Dry Season: </h3><br>The dry season in Goa typically lasts from October to May.
        During this time, the weather is warm and dry, with lower humidity
        levels. This period is the most popular for tourists visiting Goa
        because of the pleasant weather.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Temperature:</h3><br> The temperature in Goa remains relatively warm throughout
        the year. The average temperature during the cooler dry season (November
        to February) ranges from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F), while in the

      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Humidity: </h3><br>Goa experiences high humidity levels during the monsoon
        season, which can make the weather feel uncomfortable. Humidity levels

      <p>
        <h3>Rainfall:</h3><br> Goa receives the majority of its annual rainfall during the
