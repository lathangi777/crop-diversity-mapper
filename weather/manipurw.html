<p>Manipur, a state in northeastern India, experiences a humid subtropical climate, also known as a monsoon-influenced climate. Here are some key characteristics of Manipur's climate:</p>

    <p><h3>Seasonal Variation: </h3><br>Manipur's climate exhibits distinct seasons, including summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter.</p>

    <p><h3>Summer (March to June): </h3><br>Summers in Manipur are generally warm and may be accompanied by occasional rainfall. Temperatures can range from moderately warm to hot during this season.</p>

    <p><h3>Monsoon (June to September):</h3><br> The monsoon season brings heavy rainfall to Manipur. The southwest monsoon, which originates from the Bay of Bengal, brings significant precipitation to the region. The state's landscape becomes lush and green during this period.</p>

    <p><h3>Autumn (October to November):</h3><br> After the monsoon season, Manipur experiences a relatively drier and more pleasant period. The weather is usually mild, and the skies are often clear. This is considered one of the best times to visit the state.</p>
<p>
    
        <h3>Winter (December to February):</h3><br> Winters in Manipur are characterized by cool to cold temperatures. While snowfall is rare, temperatures can drop significantly, especially at higher elevations. It's advisable to carry warm clothing if visiting during this season.
</p>

    <p><h3>Humidity:</h3><br> Manipur's climate tends to be humid, especially during the monsoon season. Humidity levels can be high, contributing to the lush vegetation.</p>

    <p><h3>Scenic Beauty:</h3><br> The diverse climate and terrain in Manipur contribute to its scenic beauty. The state is known for its picturesque landscapes, including hills, valleys, and lakes.</p>

<p>
    It's important to note that Manipur's climate can vary within the state due to differences in elevation and topography. The capital city, Imphal, is situated in a valley and has a climate that may differ from the surrounding hill areas.
    
    Overall, Manipur's climate is influenced by its location in northeastern India and its proximity to the Bay of Bengal, which results in distinct seasonal changes and significant rainfall during the monsoon season.
