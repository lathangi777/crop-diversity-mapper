        Mizoram, a state in northeastern India, experiences a subtropical
        highland climate, often characterized by moderate to heavy rainfall
        during the monsoon season and relatively cooler temperatures compared to
        many other parts of India. Here are some key characteristics of
        Mizoram's climate:
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Summer (March to May):</h3><br> Summers in Mizoram are generally warm, with
        temperatures ranging from 20°C to 29°C (68°F to 84°F). However, it is
        not excessively hot compared to many other parts of India. Rainfall is
        relatively low during this season.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Monsoon (June to September):</h3><br> The monsoon season is the most significant
        in Mizoram. During this period, the state receives heavy rainfall due to
        the southwest monsoon winds. Rainfall is abundant, and humidity levels
        are high. This is the primary source of water for agriculture in the
        region.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Post-Monsoon (October to November):</h3><br> After the monsoon season, the
        rainfall gradually decreases, and the weather becomes more pleasant.
        Temperatures start to drop, and the landscape becomes lush and green.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Winter (December to February):</h3><br> Winters in Mizoram are relatively cool
        and dry. Temperatures can drop to around 11°C to 21°C (52°F to 70°F),
        especially in the higher elevations. This is the best time for tourism
        and outdoor activities in the state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, Mizoram's climate is influenced by its hilly terrain and its
        location in the northeastern part of India. The state's climate is
        conducive to agriculture, and it is known for its lush green landscapes
        and biodiversity, making it a unique and attractive region in India.
