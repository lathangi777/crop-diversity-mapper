            Uttarakhand, a state in northern India, experiences a diverse range of
            climates due to its varying topography and altitude. The climate in
            Uttarakhand can generally be categorized into the following two major
            regions:
        </p> <p>
            <h3>Himalayan Region (Mountain Climate):</h3><br> This region covers the higher
            elevations of Uttarakhand, including places like Mussoorie, Nainital, Auli,
            and the surrounding Himalayan ranges. The climate in this region varies with
            altitude:
        </p> <p>
            <h3>Alpine Climate (Higher Altitudes):</h3><br> At very high altitudes, such as
            in the upper Himalayan areas, the climate is alpine and experiences cold
            temperatures throughout the year. Winters are extremely cold with heavy
            snowfall, while summers are cool.
        </p><p>
             <h3>Sub-Alpine Climate (Lower Altitudes):</h3><br> At
            slightly lower altitudes, you'll find a sub-alpine climate with colder
            winters and milder summers. Snowfall is common during winter, making it a
            popular destination for snow sports.
        </p> <p>
            <h3>
                Terai and Bhabar Region (Plains
                Climate):
            </h3><br> The southern part of Uttarakhand, which includes areas like
            Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar, lies in the foothills of the Himalayas and
            has a more typical plain or tropical climate. This region experiences:
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Tropical Climate: </h3><br>The Terai and Bhabar regions have a hot and humid tropical
            climate during the summer months, with temperatures often exceeding 30°C
            (86°F) or more. The monsoon season during the summer brings heavy rainfall.
            Mild Winter: Winters in this region are relatively mild compared to the
            mountainous areas, with cooler temperatures but not as cold as in the
            mountains.
        </p> Uttarakhand's climate can vary significantly depending on the
        specific location and elevation within the state. It's known for its scenic
        beauty and attracts tourists throughout the year, offering opportunities for
        both winter and summer activities due to its diverse climatic zones.
